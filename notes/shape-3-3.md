Tableau with shape (3, 3)

There are a total of 5 permutations, namely [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6], [1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6], [1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6], and [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]. The first permutation (the lexicographically smallest one) has no knuth graph as there exist no relations among them.

124356, 125346, and 125346 look the same.
