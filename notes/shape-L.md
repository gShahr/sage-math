# L Shape

Tableau with shape (3, 1)

Same notes as the ones below except that there is one less tableau because of the reduced shape size.

Tableau with shape (4, 1)

There are a total of 4 graphs where one of the graphs is empty (does not have any Knuth moves). The total number of Knuth moves for each category can change by exactly 1 among the graphs with more than one vertex. In other words, a meta graph can be drawn going from one graph to another by ignoring the vertices and changing the edges (Do not need to reorder the edges).

Tableau with shape (3, 1, 1)

Two graphs with 5 vertices, three graphs with 4 vertices, and one empty graph (only one vertex; no Knuth moves). In the one with 5 vertices, they are isomorphic as they share the same structure and Knuth moves for their edges. Both relationships on the fringe while K2 is in the middle. For the graphs with 4 vertices, it has the same relationship as the ones with shape (3, 1) and shape (4, 1) as a meta graph can be made by ignoring vertices and changing edges to another Knuth move to match another graph.

# 2-Row

Tableau with shape (3, 2)

1 graph with 5 vertices, 3 graphs with 4 vertices, and 1 empty graph (1 vertex but no Knuth moves). In the one with 5 vertices, both Knuth moves are on the fringes of the graph while K2 is in the middle. The pattern for the 4 vertex graphs follow the same kind of relationship as above where one can traverse freely among them ignoring vertices while switching exactly one edge to another type of Knuth move. For one of the graphs containing 4 vertices, there are only K2 moves. (K2, K2, K2) which then goes to becoming (K2 , K2, K1) and then (K2, K1, K1).
