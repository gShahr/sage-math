Tableau with shape (3, 1)

Same notes as the ones below except that there is one less tableau because of the reduced shape size.

Tableau with shape (4, 1)

There are a total of 4 graphs where one of the graphs is empty (does not have any Knuth moves). The total number of Knuth moves for each category can change by exactly 1 among the graphs with more than one vertex. In other words, a meta graph can be drawn going from one graph to another by ignoring the vertices and changing the edges (Do not need to reorder the edges).
